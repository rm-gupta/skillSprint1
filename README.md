## Deviations

Our project closely matches the general functions mentioned in the proposal. 
For the Alpha release, we had the launch screen, the registration/login Page, the structures for core skill delivery, which are
the home Screen and skill details screen, the user profiles screens, the basic video upload screen, and a scoring system for streaks.

ADDITIONALLY, Here are our dummy credentials to test the app Right now for functionality we cannot accept passwords created with less than 6 characters due to firebase restrictions
