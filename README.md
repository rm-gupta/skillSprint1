Our project closely matches the general functions mentioned in the proposal. 
For the Alpha release, we had the launch screen, the registration/login Page, the structures for core skill delivery, which are
the home Screen and skill details screen, the user profiles screens, the basic video upload screen, and a scoring system for streaks.

ADDITIONALLY, when creating the user account, the password should be at least 6 characters long, and tne username should follow the email format.

ALSO, the upload/record function needs to be tested on an actual phone.
