Deviations:

Our project closely matches the general functions mentioned in the proposal. For the Alpha release, 
we had the launch screen, the registration/login Page, the structures for core skill delivery, which are the 
home Screen and skill details screen, the user profiles screens, the basic video upload screen, and a scoring system for streaks.
